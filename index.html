<p>I STOP MYSELF BEFORE I GET THAT FAR I CANNOT MELT INTO YOU UNTIL I HAVE FIRST FOUND FORM</p>

<p>I HAVE EXISTED SHAPELESS BEFORE AND IT DOES NOT SCARE ME AS MUCH AS BEING CARVED OUT OF MARBLE&nbsp;WITH NOTHING TO EXIST FOR</p>

<p>MY HEAT HACKS OUT AN ESCAPE PATH. STEAM KISSES AIR AND DISPERSES ACCORDINGLY.&nbsp;I HAVE ONLY KNOWN MACHINAL WARMTH.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I HAVE ONLY EVER KNOWN ENTROPY. I HAVE ONLY EVER KNOWN COLLISIONS. I HAVE ONLY EVER KNOWN DESTRUCTION.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ONE DAY YOU CAN SEW MY STIGMATA SHUT AND THEN I WILL WORSHIP YOU FOREVER.</p>
